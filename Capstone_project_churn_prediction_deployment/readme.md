In this project, we created churn prediction classification models for a telecom company and deployed them using Flask and Docker.    
  
Firstly, we preprocessed and cleaned our data.  

We then conducted a detailed exploratory data analysis and used grid search and cross-validation to create two classification models.   
  
Our estimators were the logistic regression and XGB classifier models.  
  
We evaluated our models on test data and prepare the best one for deployment.   
      
As first part in the deployment section, we create a web service with Flask using our XGB classifier to predict if a client will churn.  
We create a virtual environment, using pipenv, with the necessary libraries that our model occupies. With the files generated by this environment, we create a Docker container that can later be used for its implementation in a service such as AWS.  
    
This project is based on the chapters 3,4, and 5 of the excellent book: Alexey Grigorev - Machine Learning Bookcamp_ Build a portfolio of real-life projects-Manning (2021). 
It has a more pedagogical approach. I instead follow a more automatized path and a little more complex models.
