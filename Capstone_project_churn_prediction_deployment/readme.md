In this project, we created churn prediction classification models for a telecom company and deployed them using Flask and Docker.
Firstly, we preprocessed and cleaned our data. 
We then conducted a detailed exploratory data analysis and used grid search and cross-validation to create two classification models.
Our estimators were the logistic regression and XGB classifier models. 
We evaluated our models on test data and then deployed them for production using Flask and Docker
