# Machine_Learning_Projects_and_Notes
Notes and projects using diverse machine learning libraries in Python incluiding scikit-learn, tensorflow, and xgboost.  
The notebooks are mainly from Datacamp courses. I have completed the track of machine learning fundamentals. I also got the  
Machine Learning Specialization of Stanford University by Andrew Ng.    
The projects covers the basic steps of machine learning projects: business understanding, preprocessing and cleaning data,   
exploratory data analysis, modeling, and evaluation.
