# Machine_Learning_Projects_and_Notes
Notes and projects using diverse machine learning libraries in Python incluiding scikit-learn, tensorflow, and xgboost.  

The notebooks are mainly from Datacamp courses. I have completed the track of machine learning fundamentals. I also got the  
Machine Learning Specialization of Stanford University by Andrew Ng.     
  
The projects covers the basic steps of machine learning projects: business understanding, preprocessing and cleaning data, exploratory data analysis, modeling, evaluation, and deployment.  
  
I also recommedn this incredible book from Alexey Grigorev:  Machine Learning Bookcamp_ Build a portfolio of real-life projects-Manning (2021)
