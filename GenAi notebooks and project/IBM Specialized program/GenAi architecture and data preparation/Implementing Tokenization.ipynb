    "Tokenizers are essential tools in natural language processing that break down text into smaller units called tokens. These tokens can be words, characters, or subwords, making complex text understandable to computers. By dividing text into manageable pieces, tokenizers enable machines to process and analyze human language, powering various language-related applications like translation, sentiment analysis, and chatbots. Essentially, tokenizers bridge the gap between human language and machine understanding.\n",

    "## Tokenization with PyTorch \n",
    "In PyTorch, especially with the `torchtext` library, the tokenizer breaks down text from a data set into individual words or subwords, facilitating their conversion into numerical format. After tokenization, the vocab (vocabulary) maps these tokens to unique integers, allowing them to be fed into neural networks. This process is vital because deep learning models operate on numerical data and cannot process raw text directly. Thus, tokenization and vocabulary mapping serve as a bridge between human-readable text and machine-operable numerical data. Consider the dataset:\n"
